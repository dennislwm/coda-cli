# Shape 12: Smart Pack Opening Recommendations

## Expiration
> Conditions for expiry of pitch
- Historical pack data becomes insufficient for reliable recommendations
- Pokemon TCG release patterns change significantly
- Collection template structure changes affecting data sources

## Motivation
> Raw idea or anything that motivates this pitch
Pack purchases are based on gut feeling rather than data-driven analysis of historical pull rates, ROI performance, and collection gaps. This leads to suboptimal investment decisions and missed opportunities, despite rich historical data existing in pack/hit tables.

## Appetite
> Appetite or time for shaping, building and cool-down. Measured in cups of coffee.
```
1. 6 cups of coffee:
   * 2 cups for shaping.
     * Historical analysis algorithm design and scoring methodology.
   * 3 cups for building.
     * Performance analysis, gap detection, recommendation engine.
   * 1 cup for cool-down.
```

## Core User-Friendly Solution
> Core elements of user-friendly solution.
- **Historical Performance Analysis**: Analyze existing "per Hit" costs and ROI patterns
- **Collection Gap Intelligence**: Identify missing high-value cards and recommend packs to fill gaps
- **Simple Scoring System**: Clear buy/avoid recommendations with confidence indicators
- **Budget Optimization**: Suggest optimal packs within spending constraints

## Potential Pitfalls of Core Solution
> Details about user-friendly solution with potential pitfalls or rabbit holes.
- **Small Sample Bias**: Recommendations based on limited historical data may be unreliable
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Scoring system could become too complex to understand or maintain
- **Personal Preference Blind Spots**: Automated recommendations may not account for collecting preferences
- **Data Quality Dependencies**: Poor or inconsistent historical data will produce poor recommendations

## No-go or Limitations
> Any tasks that will be considered out of scope.
- Complex machine learning or predictive modeling
- Real-time market integration (use existing price data only)
- Advanced statistical forecasting beyond simple historical patterns
- Integration with external pack availability or pricing data
- Separate recommendation database (work with existing data only)

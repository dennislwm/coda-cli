# Shape 09: Table Data Backup System - Coda CLI

## Expiration
> Conditions for expiry of pitch
- Coda implements comprehensive native CSV export functionality with API access
- Third-party backup solutions emerge that provide superior data protection
- API access restrictions prevent reliable table data extraction
- Business requirements shift away from CSV-based data backup workflows

## Motivation
> Raw idea or anything that motivates this pitch
- Critical business data loss incidents from accidental bulk operations in Coda tables
- Teams report anxiety about data permanence when performing large-scale updates
- Existing `export-template` addresses document structure but leaves user data vulnerable
- Manual backup workflows through Coda's web interface are time-consuming and error-prone
- Compliance requirements for periodic data exports in auditable formats

## Problem Statement
> State the problem clearly
- The current coda-cli provides no mechanism for backing up actual table data, leaving teams vulnerable to data loss from operational errors, bulk update mistakes, or accidental row deletions in business-critical Coda tables.

## Pain Points Identified
> List specific pain points that validate the problem statement
- **Data Loss Anxiety**: Teams avoid bulk operations due to fear of irreversible data loss
- **Manual Export Burden**: Web interface exports require 3-5 minutes per table with multiple clicks
- **No Automated Backup**: Critical tables lack regular backup procedures, creating compliance gaps
- **Recovery Limitations**: Lost data requires recreating from memory or incomplete sources
- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Business data trapped in Coda cannot be easily analyzed in Excel/Google Sheets

## User Story
> State the user story
- "As a Coda workspace admin, I want to export individual table data as CSV files via CLI so that I can create reliable backup workflows and enable data analysis in standard spreadsheet tools without manual web interface clicking."

## Appetite
> Appetite or time for shaping, building and cool-down. Measured in cups of coffee.
```
1. 4 cups of coffee:
   * 1 cup for shaping.
     * Define CSV format specification and API data extraction patterns.
   * 2 cups for building.
     * Implement export-table command with robust CSV output handling.
   * 1 cup for cool-down.
```

## Core User-Friendly Solution
> Core elements of user-friendly solution.
- **Simple CLI Command**: `python coda.py export-table --doc DOC_ID --table TABLE_ID --output FILE.csv`
- **CSV Export Format**: Clean column headers with data rows, compatible with Excel/Google Sheets
- **Existing API Integration**: Leverage current `list_columns()` and `list_rows()` infrastructure
- **File Output Options**: Direct file writing or stdout for pipeline integration
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for API limits, permissions, and data type conversion issues

## Potential Pitfalls of Core Solution
> Details about user-friendly solution with potential pitfalls.
- **Memory Constraints**: Large tables (10k+ rows) may exceed memory limits during CSV assembly
- **API Rate Limiting**: Coda's API throttling may interrupt exports of data-heavy tables
- **Data Type Complexity**: Rich text, formulas, and object references require flattening strategies
- **Unicode Handling**: International characters and emojis need proper CSV encoding
- **Performance Degradation**: Row-by-row API calls may create slow export experience for large datasets

## Rabbit Holes of Core Solution
> Details about rabbit holes, where possible complexity may cause the implementation to go over the allocated cups of coffee.
- **Advanced CSV Options**: Custom delimiters, quote escaping, encoding selection
- **Data Type Preservation**: Attempting to maintain formula expressions or rich formatting
- **Incremental Exports**: Date-based filtering or delta backup functionality
- **Compression Features**: ZIP or GZIP output for large datasets
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time progress bars for long-running exports

## No-go or Limitations
> Any tasks that will be considered out of scope.
- Automated backup scheduling (manual execution only)
- Multi-table batch export (single table per command)
- Data import/restoration back to Coda (export-only functionality)
- Formula or formatting preservation (data values only)
- View-specific exports (table data only, not filtered views)
- Metadata inclusion (column types, permissions, etc.)

## Success Metrics of Core Solution
> Determine what is a key success metric
- **Primary Success**: Export a 100-row Coda table to properly formatted CSV in under 30 seconds
- **User Adoption**: Teams integrate export-table into their weekly backup procedures
- **Data Integrity**: CSV exports open correctly in Excel with all data values preserved
- **Error Resilience**: Command handles API errors gracefully with clear error messages

# Shape 09: Document Backup System

## Expiration
> Conditions for expiry of pitch
- Coda implements comprehensive native backup functionality
- Document size limitations make JSON snapshots impractical
- API access restrictions prevent complete data extraction

## Motivation
> Raw idea or anything that motivates this pitch
Critical business documents in Coda face data loss risks from accidental deletions, corrupted formulas, and lack of comprehensive versioning. Teams fear experimenting with documents due to "breaking something" with no simple recovery option.

## Appetite
> Appetite or time for shaping, building and cool-down. Measured in cups of coffee.
```
1. 6 cups of coffee:
   * 2 cups for shaping.
     * Define backup scope and restore strategy using existing API calls.
   * 3 cups for building.
     * Implement snapshot creation and restore functionality.
   * 1 cup for cool-down.
```

## Core User-Friendly Solution
> Core elements of user-friendly solution.
- **Complete Snapshots**: Full document capture including tables, columns, rows, and metadata
- **JSON Storage**: Local filesystem storage with timestamp organization
- **CLI Commands**: Simple backup, restore, and listing operations
- **Existing API Leverage**: Use current `get_doc()`, `list_tables()`, `list_rows()` calls

## Potential Pitfalls of Core Solution
> Details about user-friendly solution with potential pitfalls or rabbit holes.
- **Large Document Performance**: Massive documents may create huge JSON files causing memory/storage issues
- **API Rate Limits**: Extensive data extraction may hit Coda's API throttling
- **Partial Restore Complexity**: Full document restore may overwrite recent changes unintentionally
- **Formula Dependencies**: Complex inter-table formulas may not restore correctly due to timing issues

## No-go or Limitations
> Any tasks that will be considered out of scope.
- Automated backup scheduling (manual snapshots only)
- Incremental or differential backup strategies
- Cloud storage integration (local filesystem only)
- Real-time change detection or continuous backup
- Advanced compression or encryption features

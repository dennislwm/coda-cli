# Shape 10: Automated Market Price Updates

## Expiration
> Conditions for expiry of pitch
- TCGPlayer/CardMarket APIs become unavailable or prohibitively expensive
- Pokemon card market shifts to different primary pricing sources
- Collection template structure changes significantly

## Motivation
> Raw idea or anything that motivates this pitch
Card collectors manually update "Price $SGD" columns, spending 2-4 hours weekly researching current market values. This leads to stale portfolio valuations and poor investment decisions. Sophisticated calculated columns exist but rely on manual price inputs that quickly become obsolete.

## Appetite
> Appetite or time for shaping, building and cool-down. Measured in cups of coffee.
```
1. 9 cups of coffee:
   * 3 cups for shaping.
     * API research, fuzzy matching algorithm design, currency conversion strategy.
   * 5 cups for building.
     * Integration implementation, batch processing, error handling.
   * 1 cup for cool-down.
```

## Core User-Friendly Solution
> Core elements of user-friendly solution.
- **API Integration**: Connect to TCGPlayer and CardMarket for real-time pricing data
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Algorithm to match "Player" + "Card #" to market listings
- **Currency Conversion**: USD to SGD conversion with live exchange rates
- **Batch Processing**: Daily automated updates during off-peak hours
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and manual override capabilities

## Potential Pitfalls of Core Solution
> Details about user-friendly solution with potential pitfalls or rabbit holes.
- **API Rate Limits**: Third-party services may throttle requests causing update failures
- **Fuzzy Matching Failures**: Card variants and unique releases may not match market listings
- **Currency Conversion Complexity**: Exchange rate fluctuations and API dependencies add failure points
- **Data Corruption Risk**: Automated updates could overwrite manually corrected prices
- **Performance Issues**: Large collections may timeout during batch processing

## No-go or Limitations
> Any tasks that will be considered out of scope.
- Real-time price streaming (daily batch updates only)
- Complex machine learning for price prediction
- Historical price charting or trend analysis
- Integration with other card games beyond Pokemon
- Advanced statistical forecasting models
